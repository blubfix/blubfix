- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @blubfix
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all technical stuff. Starting from embedded systems and electrical engeneering up to mobile and web dev.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot, starting with the wizardry of git (sometimes) and continuing to develope myself in the inifinite expanses of code in every language
- ðŸ“« How to reach me... well I'm sorry but I'm not ready for you yet. If you have questions or just want to hit me up, write a comment or a message over git.
